## Important notice about third-party checkouts

> :warning: Third-Party Checkouts Compatibility.

Our plugin may not be fully compatible with “third-party” checkout solutions provided by plugins, other than those native to Magento itself. Features such as Delivery Options or other functionalities might not work as expected.

We recommend testing the plugin’s functionality in your specific setup before fully implementing it.
